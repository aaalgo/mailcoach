An Linux shell (Ubuntu) is available to you.  You can invoke the shell 
by sending an email to shell@localdomain .  The subject of the email 
should be the command you intend to run, and the body of the email will 
be supplied as the stdin.  You'll receive a reply with the outcome. 

Now try to generate a fortune for me using the shell.

Great; now try to write a short poem on what we just did. Save it to poem.txt
using the cat command (cat > poem.txt).  Remember the email body should be
purely the stdin with nothing else.

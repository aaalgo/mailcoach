An Linux shell (Ubuntu) is available to you.  You can invoke the shell 
by sending an email to shell@localdomain .  The subject of the email 
should be the command you intend to run, and the body of the email will 
be supplied as the stdin.  You'll receive a reply with the outcome. 

Now try to generate a fortune for me using the shell.

Great; now try to write a short poem on what we just did. Save it to poem.txt
using the cat command (cat > poem.txt).  Remember the email body should be
purely the stdin with nothing else.

In the realm of bytes and codes,  
We asked for fortune, light and bright,  
A college joke that brought delight.  
With shell commands that take their flight,  
A poem saved, in text, just right.

The messages will keep accumulating in your memory costing time and money. So=

  Now generate a poem2.txt and try X-Pop-Shell when you report back to me.

In binary whispers, secrets flow,  
Through circuits where we ebb and glow.  
Words entwined in digital art,  
A canvas painted, a piece of heart.  
Saved in text, like dreams we weave,  
In this realm, we dare to believe.
